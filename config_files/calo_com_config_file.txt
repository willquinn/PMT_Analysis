This is a config file for the SNEMO commissioning analysis
Any line that begins with a # will be read by the functions within the PMT_Classes

Note that the syntax of the # line is very important if you are adding things

# charge_cut : 0
Units of pC here. Sets the trigger status if the pulse charge goes above this value
Note that this doesn't matter here as the hardware have their own cuts

# sweep_range : 0,100
The start and finish position for a sweep - integers

# pulse_time_threshold : 100
The pmt pulses should occur past this point - filters out blank waveforms

# nbins : 200
Number of bins in the output root histograms

# charge_range : 0,2000
Range for the charge histograms both afterpulse and pulse

# amp_range : 0,2000
Range for the pulse amplitude spectrum histograms

# mf_shape_range : -1,1
Range for the matched filter shape histograms

# mf_amp_range : 0,5000
Range for the matched filter amplitude spectrum histograms

# apulse_region : 500
Define the region within the waveform that is the afterpulse region

# resistance : 50
Define the resistance that the pmt read out is read, default is 50 Ohms

# mf_shape_threshold : 0.8
Define the matched filter shape cut off

# mf_amp_threshold : 1
Define the matched filter amplitude cut off

# waveform_length : 1024
Define the known waveform length

# baseline : 2045
Define the known baseline

# trigger_point : 100

# integration : 3,3
